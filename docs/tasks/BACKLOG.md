# wife-cv task backlog

Source of truth for task state = each task's frontmatter `status`. This file indexes them.
ONE backlog for ALL work: net-new features (`class: product`, the default) and
hardening/refactor/audit-remediation (`class: improvement`) live here together —
improvement is not a separate track and never gets a second backlog file. Tag
improvement rows with `(improvement)`; untagged rows are product.

task files live under `docs/tasks/`: flat (`TASK-001-slug.md`) for small
repos, or grouped in subfolders by module for larger ones. `improvement/` is a
normal subfolder there for cross-cutting hardening tasks.

The `ship-tasks` workflow reads this file, picks the first eligible task
(`ready_to_implement` with all `depends_on` done), and drives it through the
lifecycle. HITL is required: the agent halts at review acceptance and final
acceptance for a recorded human verdict, and never sets `done` itself.

Lifecycle: draft -> ready_to_implement -> implementing -> ready_to_review -> reviewing ->
ready_to_test -> testing -> done. Off-ramps: on_hold, closed. See
`.cyberos/cuo/STATUS-REFERENCE.md`.

## ready_to_implement

- (none yet - add rows as `- [ready_to_implement] TASK-001-slug - title`; append `(improvement)` for hardening tasks)

## in flight

- (implementing / reviewing / testing tasks appear here)

## done

- (shipped tasks, for the audit trail)

## on_hold / closed

- (deferred or killed tasks)
